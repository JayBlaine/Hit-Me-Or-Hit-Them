BlackJack Rules:

All face cards are equal to 10, an ace is 1 or 11, and all numeric cards are the same value as their number

1) Two cards are dealt to the player and the dealer
	a) All cards of the player are face up
	b) One card of the dealer is face up 
2) The player can hit or stand
	a) If the player chooses to hit then another card is dealt and is face up
	b) If the player stands then the dealer's face down card must be faced up. If the dealer has a total of:
		1) 16 or less: the dealer must be dealt cards until the total is 17 or more
		2) 17 or more: the dealer stands
		3) If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring the total to 17 or more (but not over 21), the dealer must count the ace as 11 and stand
3) The player wins if they have a total greater than the dealer


War Rules: 

Ace is the highest card and beats all cards
King is the second highest and beats Quen, Jack, and numeric cards
Queen is the third highest and beats the Jack and numeric cars
Jack is the fourth highest and beats all numeric cards
All numeric cards are the same value as their number

1) The player and opponent must be dealt 26 cards each (half of the deck to each person)
2) Both the player and opponent must flip the top card of their deck at the same time
	a) The player wins both the opponent's flipped card and keeps their flipped card if the player has a higher value card.
		Ex) if the player flipped a Jack and the opponent flipped an eight then the player keeps their Jack and the opponent's eight
	b) The opponent wins if they flip a higher value card and keeps the player's flipped card and their card
		Ex) if the player flipped a Jack and the opponent flipped a King then the opponent keeps their King and the player's Jack
	c) If the player and opponent flip cards with equal value then they must take their top three cards out from their deck (face down) and then flip a card from their decks each.
		1) Player flipped the higher value card: if the player flipped a Jack and the opponent flipped an eight then the player keeps their Jack and the opponent's eight. Along with the three face down cards the player put down
		   and the three flipped down cards the oppoenent put down
		2) Opponent flipped the higher value card: if the player flipped a Jack and the opponent flipped a King then the opponent keeps their King and the player's Jack. Along with the three face down cards the player put down
		   and the three face down cards the oppoenent put down
		3) If the player and opponent flip over cards with equal value then they flip their first face down card and whoever wins keeps all the flipped over cards and the face down cards. If the cards are still equivalent then they flip the next 
		   face down card, and if those are still equivalent then the flip their last face down card.
3) The player wins if they have all 52 cards in the deck.
