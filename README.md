When updating the project you can not use the website. I have been updating the project by using the git bash application that is already installed on the computers (If you have any other methods that you feel more comfortable with please use them). The website attached is what I use to help me commit my changes.
For step 4 I typically type git add Applicatoion Project* so that anything for the Application Project is committed (At this point nothing is committed yet we are just gathering the files we want to commit)
For step 5 please write a meaningful message so we know what you've done. I think there is a limited amount of characters so just keep it short and sweet
For step 6 I type git push origin master and it will commit the files to the repository. Before exiting I highly suggest you check github to make sure everything is committed
